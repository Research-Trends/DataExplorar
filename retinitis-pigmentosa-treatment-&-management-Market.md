With approximately 1 in 4,000 individuals affected by RP globally, the demand for effective treatment options is propelling research and funding within this niche segment. The global market size for RP treatments is projected to reach <strong>$8 billion</strong> by 2024, reflecting a robust compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of <strong>12%</strong> over the forecast period.</p><p>The rising incidence of RP, coupled with an aging population, is another contributing factor to the market's expansion. The growing prevalence of congenital and age-related eye disorders is leading to heightened interest in therapies that target the underlying genetic causes of RP. Moreover, the increase in collaborations between academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies is fueling innovation and accelerating the development of new treatments, such as retinal implants and stem cell therapies.</p><p><strong><span style="color: #800000;">Download Full PDF Sample Copy of Retinitis Pigmentosa Treatment & Management Market Report @</span>&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/477811/?utm_source=Pulse-2&amp;utm_medium=334">https://www.marketsizeandtrends.com/download-sample/477811/?utm_source=Pulse-2&amp;utm_medium=334</a></p><p>By 2032, the market is expected to experience even more substantial growth, with forecasts estimating it could surpass <strong>$15 billion</strong>.
